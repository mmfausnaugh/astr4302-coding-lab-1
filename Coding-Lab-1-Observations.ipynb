    "In this coding lab, we will learn some basic Python syntax. We will learn how to define a function, and perform several rounds of large calculations in the blink of an eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Coding Lab assumes you do not have any experience with Python or programming. If you want to skip down to Section 5, that is where the problems begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Effort:** To receive a check, you need to demonstrate full effort. You should run your code in every cell (Shift+Enter). If the code raises an error, you should try to debug it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to debug things for 2 or 3 hours but can't get it to work, make a note of where you stopped with a comment or print function in the cell. Explain in one or two sentences what the error or problem that you are seeing is and what confusion(s) it is causing you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't give an explanation of why there are errors in your code cells or why you did not complete the notebook, you will receive a check-minus.\n",
    "\n",
    "A check-plus is worth extra credit---one check-plus balances a check-minus. So a check-plus gives you an extra 1.5 percentage points on your final grade. I will help you with the coding lab if you bring it to office hours or make an appointment.\n",
